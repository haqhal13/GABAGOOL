# Easy Wallet Configuration
# ===========================
# Add addresses below to watch traders. Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# METHODS TO ADD ADDRESSES:
# 1. Edit this file - Add addresses below (one per line or comma-separated)
# 2. Use /add command - While bot is running, type: /add 0x... [optional_alias]
# 3. Edit watchlist.json - Direct JSON editing for advanced users
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   Single address:    0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
#   Multiple (comma):  0xABC..., 0xDEF..., 0x123...
#   Multiple (lines):  Put each address on its own line
#
# RUNTIME COMMANDS (type while bot is running):
#   /add <address> [alias]   - Add new address to watch
#   /remove <address|alias>  - Remove address from watchlist
#   /toggle <address|alias>  - Enable/disable an address
#   /alias <address> <name>  - Set friendly name for address
#   /list                    - Show all watched addresses
#   /help                    - Show all commands
#
# NOTE: Once watchlist.json is created (on first run), it becomes the
# primary source for addresses. This wallet file is used as initial seed.
